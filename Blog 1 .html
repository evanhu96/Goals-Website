        <h2>The Goal Of This Blog/Website</h2>
        <p>The big goal of this blog/website is to have a place to practice all the new things I learn and apply new skills regularly. </p>
        <p>I plan on making numerous links to websites that I make for the different goals I have in life (first time blogging I'll appreciate it if you excuse the poor typing), these individual websites will provide me a place to track, expand and improve my growth over many areas</p>
        <p>This blog portion will mainly deal with what new things I've learned and the websites will showcase that new knowledge</p>
